		answer:
			"Writing a review is easy! Just go to the 'Lists' section in your sidebar, expand the list that contains the movie you want to review, and click on the movie. A dialog window will open. To write a review, you'll need to change the movie's status to either 'Completed' or 'Dropped'. Once one of these statuses is selected, a text area will appear where you can write your review and submit a rating from 1 to 10. When you're done, click the 'Submit Review' button to save it.",

		question: 'How does the "Browse" feature works?',
		answer:
			"The Browse feature lets you customize your movie search experience. You can filter movies by genre, release year, and sort options like 'Popularity', 'Release Date', 'TMDB Rating', and 'Title'. You can also choose the order in which results are displayed based on the selected sort option. At the top, there's a search bar that allows you to search for any show by title. Please note that the search bar and the filters below it cannot be used together — you must choose either the filters or the search bar, but not both at the same time.",
